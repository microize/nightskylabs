# Blog Management System - NightSkyLabs

## 📝 Production-Style Blog System

This document explains how to add, manage, and maintain blog posts on the NightSkyLabs website. The system supports individual blog post pages, automatic slug generation, SEO optimization, and dynamic content loading.

## 🚀 Quick Start - Adding a New Blog Post

### Step 1: Create the Markdown File
1. Navigate to `/src/content/blog/`
2. Create a new `.md` file with a descriptive name (e.g., `ai-automation-trends-2025.md`)
3. The filename will become the URL slug: `/blog/ai-automation-trends-2025`

### Step 2: Use the Blog Template
Copy this template for your new blog post:

```markdown
---
title: "Your Blog Post Title Here"
excerpt: "A compelling description that appears in listings and search results"
author: "Author Name"
date: "2025-01-15"
tags: ["Technology", "AI", "Development"]
category: "Technology"
featured: false
slug: "your-custom-slug"
image: "hero-image.jpg"
